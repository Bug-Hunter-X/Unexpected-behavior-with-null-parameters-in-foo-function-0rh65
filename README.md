# Unexpected Null Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common issue in JavaScript where functions don't explicitly handle null or undefined parameters, leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures.

## Bug Description

The `foo` function, as initially written, doesn't correctly handle null or undefined values for the `a` and `b` parameters. It simply returns without any error handling, potentially masking issues.

## Solution

The corrected `foo` function includes explicit null checks and provides appropriate handling for null parameters, either by throwing an error, returning a default value, or taking other suitable action.
